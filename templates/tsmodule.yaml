  Answer with a valid TypeScript module, including importing all required dependencies.
  Do not use the type `any` in your code.
  Only the module code is required, do not include any explanation. The code must compile with tsc.
  Do not wrap the response in markdown code blocks, all the response must be TypeScript code only.
